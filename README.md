# Twin-Oaks-Radio
A Post-Apocalyptic Radio Show 


Twin Oaks Radio is our answer to the age old question “What remnants of our culture would exist after a destructive event?”.  Like many lost cultures, all that would remain are physical artifacts: our buildings, our writings, and our music. The only music that would exist after such a cataclysmic event would be old school records, since their physical form makes them accessible in low technology situations. Twin Oaks Radio is a radio station which attempts to piece together our culture through a few faulty sources.
